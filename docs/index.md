# Forecasting System Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Forecasting System.

This project provides a scalable and automated time series forecasting pipeline designed for real-time and batch use cases, with model selection, data clustering, and hierarchical reconciliation.

Use the sidebar to explore documentation sections including models used, pipeline structure, deployment workflow, and technical appendices.

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a sales forecasting system, **a large-scale retailer with numerous stores distributed across multiple geographic regions**. The forecasting model is designed to capture the unique characteristics of each store and product group - across five main product categories: Fresh Food, Packaged Food, Home & Personal Care, Household Items, and Apparel - as well as regional differences across locations.

The entire pipeline is fully automated following the standard machine learning lifecycle, **including data ingestion, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and evaluation and deployment**. Forecasts are generated in both batch and real-time formats. Time series data is thoroughly analyzed **using features such as trend, seasonality and volatility,** followed by KMeans clustering to optimize forecast accuracy for different store and product group profiles.

The system integrates several tools to ensure reliability, reusability and scalability: **DVC** for data version control, **MLflow** for model lifecycle management, **FastAPI** for serving prediction APIs, **Airflow** for orchestration of data processing workflows, **Slack notifications** for real-time monitoring and alerts and **a Data Pipeline framework** to manage end-to-end processing.

This solution enables the business team to better plan sales, allocate resources more efficiently, and make data-driven decisions quickly, by leveraging both historical data and future projections.
